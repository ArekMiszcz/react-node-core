# React Node Core

This is a simple example how i solved a problem with graphic representation of logic operation
 by using SVG and d3js library.

This is only introduction to more advanced system which i plan to create.

At this moment it looks like this:

![Example View](example.png?raw=true "Example View")

---

What i plan to do in near future:
* Make paths removable
* Make nodes removable
* Create panel which allow adding new nodes to the view
* Create new types of nodes

---

This example is created in React, Flux and d3js technology and this is my first project
where i using those technologies so don't hesitate to make some commits or
mail to [me](mailto:arkadiusz.miszczyszyn@gmail.com).
